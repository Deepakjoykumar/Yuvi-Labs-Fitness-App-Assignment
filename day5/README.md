# day-5

 --> Today I have worked with colour gradients in circular progress i have used different colour gradients and adjusted some fonts .

 --> And I have checked rules Given below:

All files and folder names throughout the assignment repo should be in snake_case
Class names should be in PascalCase
Class instances, functions, variables, field values should be in camelCase
Code should be separated into simpler functions wherever possible. Deep nesting of code is not allowed.

 --> Almost my UI is completed and next i will accuracy.
